      { label: 'ATM Strategy', text: 'Use bank ATMs (Geldautomat) attached to major banks like Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Sparkasse, or Volksbank. Avoid standalone ATMs in tourist areas — they charge higher fees and poor exchange rates. Always choose "withdraw without conversion" to avoid dynamic currency conversion markups.' },
      { label: 'Cash is King', text: 'Germany is surprisingly cash-oriented. Many restaurants, smaller shops, bakeries, and even some hotels are cash-only or cash-preferred. Always carry at least 50-100 EUR in cash. Credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) work at hotels, larger restaurants, and chain stores. Amex and Discover are rarely accepted. The German love of Bargeld (cash) catches many visitors off guard.' },
      { label: 'Tipping Norms', text: 'Tipping is customary in Germany — round up or leave 5-10% for good service. When paying the bill, tell the server the total you\'d like to pay (e.g., "Stimmt so" means "keep the change"). Tip 1-2 EUR for hotel porters. Taxi drivers: round up to the nearest euro. Don\'t leave coins on the table — hand the tip directly.' },

ICE high-speed trains link Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne, and Frankfurt at speeds up to 300 km/h. IC/EC trains cover medium distances. Regional trains (RE/RB) are affordable and reach smaller towns. Book at bahn.com — advance tickets (Sparpreis) start at 17.90 EUR and save significantly over walk-up fares.' },

FlixTrain operates on select routes at competitive prices. Both are comfortable with WiFi and power outlets.' },

Not valid on ICE or IC trains. Incredible value for travelers staying more than a few days. Buy digitally through the DB Navigator app or local transit apps.' },
      { label: 'Domestic Flights', text: 'Lufthansa, Eurowings, and Ryanair connect major German cities in 1-2 hours. Flights start at 30-60 EUR one-way if booked early. Useful for Berlin to Munich (1 hour vs. 4 by train). Major airports: Frankfurt (FRA), Munich (MUC), Berlin (BER), Hamburg (HAM), Düsseldorf (DUS), Cologne/Bonn (CGN).' },
      { label: 'Rental Cars & Autobahn', text: 'Germany\'s Autobahn is famous for sections without speed limits — but many stretches have limits of 100-130 km/h. Rental cars start at 30-50 EUR/day. An international driving permit (IDP) is recommended for non-EU licenses. Parking in cities is expensive — park-and-ride or use public transport instead. The Romantic Road, Black Forest, and Rhine Valley are best explored by car.' },
      { label: 'City Transport', text: 'German cities have excellent public transport — U-Bahn (subway), S-Bahn (commuter rail), trams, and buses. Buy tickets from machines before boarding and validate them — plain-clothes inspectors issue 60 EUR fines for riding without a valid ticket. Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and Cologne have extensive networks. Ride-hailing apps like FreeNow and Uber work in major cities.' },

Bring your passport — registration is required by German law.' },

      { label: 'WiFi Availability', text: 'Free WiFi is available at most hotels, many cafes, and train stations. German WiFi is generally fast — 30-100 Mbps is typical. DB trains offer WiFi in ICE first class (free) and second class (limited). Having mobile data as backup is recommended for navigation and translation.' },

      { label: 'EHIC / GHIC (EU Citizens)', text: 'EU citizens should carry a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). It covers state-provided medical treatment at the same cost as German residents — meaning most emergency care is free or very low cost.' },
      { label: 'Hospitals & Pharmacies', text: 'Germany has excellent healthcare. In emergencies, call 112 (EU emergency number) or 110 (police). Pharmacies (Apotheke, marked with a red A) are well-stocked and pharmacists are knowledgeable. Many medications require a prescription. Rotation schedules ensure at least one Apotheke is open 24/7 in each area — check aponet.de for the nearest one.' },
      { label: 'Tap Water', text: 'German tap water is safe to drink everywhere — it\'s rigorously tested and often higher quality than bottled water. Restaurants will serve tap water if you ask for "Leitungswasser," though many prefer to sell bottled Mineralwasser. Bring a reusable water bottle — refill stations and public fountains are common in cities.' },
      { label: 'Pickpocket Awareness', text: 'Germany is very safe, but pickpocketing can occur in crowded tourist areas — especially in Berlin (Alexanderplatz, major S-Bahn stations), Munich (Oktoberfest, Marienplatz), and Cologne (around the cathedral). Use a crossbody bag or front-zip backpack. Keep your phone in your front pocket. Violent crime against tourists is extremely rare.' },
      { label: 'Driving Safety', text: 'The Autobahn is well-maintained but fast-moving — stay in the right lane unless overtaking. City parking is tight and expensive. Speed cameras are common and fines are enforced even for foreign drivers.

      { label: 'Layered Clothing', text: 'German weather is changeable — even in summer, temperatures can drop in the evening or shift quickly. Pack layers: a light jacket, a sweater, and a rain layer. Spring and fall require a proper jacket. Winter demands a warm coat, scarf, hat, and gloves — especially for Christmas markets. Summers are warm (25-35°C) but rarely tropical.' },
      { label: 'Power Adapters', text: 'Germany uses Type C (2 round pins) and Type F (2 round pins with grounding clips) plugs at 230V. Bring a universal adapter or a European plug adapter. Your phone chargers and laptops are dual-voltage and work fine. Hair dryers and curling irons need to be rated 110-240V — check before plugging in.' },
      { label: 'Comfortable Walking Shoes', text: 'German cities are very walkable, with cobblestone streets, castle ruins, and historic centers to explore. Wear proper walking shoes — not flip-flops, not brand-new shoes. Break them in before your trip. You\'ll walk 10-15 km per day easily exploring Berlin, Munich, or Heidelberg.' },
      { label: 'Rain Gear', text: 'Rain is possible year-round in Germany, especially in the north and west. Pack a compact umbrella or a lightweight waterproof jacket. Don\'t let rain deter you — some of the most atmospheric German experiences (Christmas markets, castle visits, forest hikes) happen in misty or drizzly conditions.' },
      { label: 'Sunday Prep', text: 'Almost all shops are closed on Sundays in Germany (Sonntagsruhe — Sunday rest). Stock up on groceries, toiletries, and essentials on Saturday. Gas stations and some train station shops are exceptions. Restaurants, museums, and tourist attractions are open as normal. This catches many visitors by surprise — plan ahead.' },
      { label: 'Day Bag & Pfand', text: 'Carry a crossbody bag or small backpack for daily exploring — phone, water bottle, rain layer, adapter, and cash. Germany has a Pfand (deposit) system on most bottles and cans (0.08-0.25 EUR each) — return them at supermarket machines for a receipt. Bring a reusable bag — plastic bags cost extra at stores.' },

(how much?), "Die Rechnung, bitte" (the bill, please), "Wo ist die Toilette?" (where\'s the bathroom?), "Sprechen Sie Englisch?" (do you speak English?). Even a few words earn a warmer welcome — Germans genuinely appreciate the effort.' },
      { label: 'Greetings & Formality', text: 'Germans are more formal than Americans. Use "Sie" (formal you) with strangers and in professional settings; "du" (informal you) with friends. Handshakes are the standard greeting — firm, brief, with eye contact. In Bavaria, "Grüß Gott" replaces "Guten Tag." In the north, "Moin" is the all-purpose greeting. Don\'t be offended by German directness — it\'s cultural, not rude.' },
      { label: 'Dining Etiquette', text: 'Germans eat earlier than Southern Europeans — lunch at noon-1 PM, dinner from 6-8 PM. Say "Guten Appetit" before eating. Water is not automatically served — order Mineralwasser (sparkling or still). Bread may have a small charge. The bill won\'t come until you ask — say "Zahlen, bitte." Tipping 5-10% is customary for good service. Many restaurants are cash-only.' },
      { label: 'German Beer Culture', text: 'Beer is central to German social life. The Reinheitsgebot (Beer Purity Law) of 1516 still influences brewing today. In Bavaria, Biergärten are communal — you can bring your own food but buy beer there. In Cologne, Kölsch is served in small glasses (0.2L) and refilled automatically until you place a coaster on top. In Berlin, Kneipen (pubs) are for casual drinks and conversation.' },
      { label: 'Quiet Hours & Rules', text: 'Germans value rules and order. Quiet hours (Ruhezeit) apply from 10 PM to 6 AM and all day Sunday — no loud music, construction, or excessive noise. Don\'t jaywalk — even when the street is empty, Germans wait for the green light. Recycling is taken seriously — separate glass, paper, and packaging. Queue patiently and don\'t cut in line.' },
      { label: 'Regional Differences', text: 'Germany has strong regional identities. Bavarians, Berliners, Rhinelanders, and Northern Germans each have distinct traditions, dialects, and cuisines. Bavaria is more traditional and Catholic; the north is more Protestant and reserved. Eastern Germany has its own post-reunification identity. Berlin is a world unto itself — international, creative, and counter-cultural. Don\'t assume Germany is homogeneous — each region takes pride in its own character.' },

  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "Do I need a visa to visit Germany?", answer: "Most nationalities (US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and 50+ others) can enter Germany visa-free for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Germany is part of the Schengen Area, so this covers all Schengen countries combined. Starting in 2026, visa-exempt travelers will also need ETIAS authorization (7 EUR, valid for 3 years). Bring your passport with at least 3 months' validity beyond your departure date." },
    { question: "Is Germany safe for tourists?", answer: "Germany is very safe for tourists. Violent crime against visitors is extremely rare. The main concern is minor petty theft in crowded areas of Berlin (Alexanderplatz, major transit hubs) and at large events like Oktoberfest. Use common sense: carry a crossbody bag, keep your phone in a front pocket, be alert on crowded public transport. Tourist areas are well-policed. Germany ranks among the safest countries in Europe." },
    { question: "How much does a trip to Germany cost?", answer: "Budget travelers: 50-80 EUR/day covers hostels, bakery lunches, and public transport. Mid-range: 120-200 EUR/day for 3-star hotels, Gasthäuser, and museum entry. Luxury: 300+ EUR/day for boutique hotels, fine dining, and private tours. A 7-day mid-range trip for two costs roughly 2,500-4,000 EUR total including accommodation, meals, trains, and activities. Germany is moderately priced by Western European standards." },
    { question: "What is the best way to get around Germany?", answer: "Deutsche Bahn (DB) trains connect every major city — ICE high-speed trains link Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and Cologne. The 49 EUR Deutschland-Ticket covers all local and regional transport. FlixBus offers budget intercity connections. Rental cars are great for the Romantic Road, Black Forest, and Rhine Valley. In cities, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams, and buses are excellent. Book trains at bahn.com for advance-purchase discounts." },
    { question: "When is the best time to visit Germany?", answer: "May-June and September-October offer the best combination of pleasant weather, manageable crowds, and lower prices. July-August is warm but busy, especially in Bavaria and popular cities. Late September brings Oktoberfest. November-December is Christmas market season — magical but cold. Winter in Berlin and northern Germany is grey and chilly, but southern Germany and the Alps offer skiing. Spring brings blooming gardens and fewer tourists." },
    { question: "Do I need to speak German?", answer: "English is widely spoken in tourist areas, hotels, and restaurants — especially in Berlin, Munich, and major cities. Smaller towns and rural areas may have limited English. Learning basic phrases (Hallo, Danke, Bitte, Entschuldigung) goes a long way and earns genuine appreciation. Younger Germans almost universally speak English; older generations may not. Google Translate works well offline if you download the German language pack." },
