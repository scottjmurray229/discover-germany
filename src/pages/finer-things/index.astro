      { label: 'Riesling', text: 'Germany\'s most celebrated grape — from bone-dry (<em>trocken</em>) to lusciously sweet (<em>Spätlese</em>, <em>Auslese</em>). The Mosel, Rheingau, and Pfalz produce world-class Riesling. A bottle runs <strong>€8–25</strong> at a wine shop and <strong>€5–10 per glass</strong> at a Weinstube. Look for producers like <strong>Dr. Loosen</strong>, <strong>Schloss Johannisberg</strong>, or <strong>Dönnhoff</strong>. The mineral, petrol-tinged dry Rieslings of the Rheingau are legendary.' },
      { label: 'Spätburgunder (Pinot Noir)', text: 'Germany\'s finest red — elegant, nuanced, with notes of cherry, raspberry, and earth. The Ahr Valley, Baden, and Pfalz produce outstanding examples. Bottles start at <strong>€10–30</strong>. By-the-glass at a wine bar, expect <strong>€6–12</strong>. Often lighter than French Burgundy but equally complex. Try <strong>Meyer-Näkel</strong>, <strong>Friedrich Becker</strong>, or <strong>Bernhard Huber</strong> for world-class Spätburgunder.' },
      { label: 'Gewürztraminer', text: 'An aromatic, intensely floral white from Pfalz and Baden — lychee, rose petal, and spice notes. Bold and distinctive. A bottle runs <strong>€8–18</strong>. Perfect with Asian-inspired dishes and spicy food. Germany\'s version is often drier and more refined than Alsatian examples. A glass of chilled Gewürztraminer on a terrace along the Rhine is pure pleasure.' },
      { label: 'Silvaner & Müller-Thurgau', text: 'Franconia\'s signature grapes — Silvaner is earthy, herbal, and mineral-driven, served in the distinctive round <em>Bocksbeutel</em> bottle. <strong>€6–15</strong> per bottle. Müller-Thurgau is lighter, floral, and easy-drinking — the everyday white of Germany. Both pair beautifully with Franconian cuisine — sausages, freshwater fish, and hearty soups.' },
      { label: 'Wine Regions & Weinstube Culture', text: 'Germany has 13 official wine regions. The <strong>Mosel</strong> has steep slate vineyards along the river. The <strong>Rheingau</strong> produces aristocratic Rieslings. The <strong>Pfalz</strong> is the warmest and most productive. <strong>Franconia</strong> (around Würzburg) specializes in dry Silvaner. A <em>Weinstube</em> (wine tavern) is the heart of German wine culture — cozy, wood-paneled, serving local wines by the glass with seasonal dishes. Expect <strong>€3–8</strong> per glass.' },
      { label: 'How Germans Actually Drink Wine', text: 'Wine is deeply regional in Germany. Locals drink their region\'s wine — Mosel Riesling in the Mosel, Trollinger in Stuttgart, Silvaner in Franconia. <strong>Weinschorle</strong> (wine spritzer) is hugely popular in summer — white wine mixed with sparkling water. <strong>€3–5</strong> per glass. Germans drink wine with meals, at festivals, and at the <em>Straußwirtschaft</em> (seasonal pop-up wine taverns run by vintners). Wine fests in autumn are major social events — the Wurstmarkt in Bad Dürkheim is the world\'s largest wine festival.' },

A half-liter (<em>Halbe</em>) costs <strong>€3–5</strong> at a beer garden, <strong>€4–7</strong> at a restaurant. Augustiner Helles on draft at a Munich beer garden is one of Germany\'s great pleasures.' },
      { label: 'Weißbier (Wheat Beer)', text: 'Bavaria\'s signature style — cloudy, fruity, with banana and clove notes from the yeast. Served in tall, curved glasses. <strong>Weihenstephan</strong> (the world\'s oldest brewery, since 1040), <strong>Erdinger</strong>, and <strong>Schneider</strong> are the classic brands. A half-liter runs <strong>€3.50–6</strong>. Traditionally a morning beer — Bavarians drink <em>Weißwurst-Frühstück</em> (white sausage breakfast) with Weißbier before noon. It\'s not a tourist gimmick; locals genuinely do this.' },
      { label: 'Kölsch & Altbier', text: '<strong>Kölsch</strong> — Cologne\'s protected pale ale, served in small 0.2L glasses (<em>Stangen</em>) from a circular tray (<em>Kranz</em>). The waiter keeps bringing rounds until you cover your glass with a coaster. <strong>€1.50–2.50</strong> per glass. Try <strong>Früh</strong>, <strong>Gaffel</strong>, or <strong>Reissdorf</strong>. <strong>Altbier</strong> is Düsseldorf\'s answer — copper-colored, malty, bitter. There\'s a legendary rivalry between the two cities over which is better.' },
      { label: 'Biergarten Etiquette', text: 'Beer gardens are sacred in Bavaria — and spreading nationwide. The rules: you <strong>can bring your own food</strong> to the communal tables (but buy drinks there). Sit wherever there\'s room — sharing tables with strangers is expected. Order at the counter or from servers depending on the garden. <strong>A Maß (1 liter)</strong> costs <strong>€8–12</strong> at major beer gardens. <strong>Augustiner Keller</strong>, <strong>Hirschgarten</strong>, and <strong>Viktualienmarkt</strong> in Munich are legendary.' },

Regional specialties: <strong>Rauchbier</strong> (smoked beer) from Bamberg at <strong>Schlenkerla</strong>, <strong>Schwarzbier</strong> (black beer) from Thuringia, <strong>Berliner Weisse</strong> with a shot of raspberry or woodruff syrup in Berlin. Craft breweries are booming in Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich.' },

The <em>Pfand</em> (deposit) system means you pay €0.08–0.25 extra per bottle and get it back when you return empties. At festivals like Oktoberfest, expect <strong>€13–15 per Maß</strong>. The cheapest great beer: a €1 Augustiner from a Munich Spätkauf, drunk at the English Garden.' },

Head to a <em>Konditorei</em> (pastry shop/café) for <strong>Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte</strong> (Black Forest cake), <strong>Bienenstich</strong> (bee sting cake), or <strong>Käsekuchen</strong> (cheesecake). A slice of cake plus coffee runs <strong>€5–9</strong>. <strong>Café Einstein</strong> in Berlin, <strong>Café Luitpold</strong> in Munich, and traditional Konditoreien in every town keep this tradition alive. It\'s the German equivalent of afternoon tea — civilized, indulgent, and deeply social.' },

Espresso culture is strong too, especially in cities — a proper espresso runs <strong>€2–3</strong>. <strong>Milchkaffee</strong> (coffee with lots of hot milk) and <strong>Latte Macchiato</strong> are extremely popular. Germany is the third-largest coffee consumer per capita in the world — they take it seriously.' },

Flat whites, pour-overs, and single-origin espressos run <strong>€3–5</strong>. Berlin\'s café culture is also about lingering — laptops, books, and three-hour sits are completely normal. Many cafés don\'t have WiFi passwords; they just trust you.' },
      { label: 'Konditorei Tradition', text: 'A <em>Konditorei</em> is a traditional German pastry shop and café — often family-run for generations. Unlike modern coffee shops, Konditoreien focus on pastries and cakes made fresh daily. <strong>Dresdner Eierschecke</strong> (a layered quark cake from Dresden), <strong>Frankfurter Kranz</strong> (buttercream crown cake), and <strong>Nussecken</strong> (nut corners) are regional specialties.

Hamburg has a long coffee trading history — the Speicherstadt was once the world\'s largest coffee storage facility.' },

The golden rule: tourist areas charge more, but even in the most central locations, coffee rarely exceeds €5. Chain bakeries like <strong>Balzac Coffee</strong> and <strong>Einstein Kaffee</strong> offer consistent quality. For the cheapest good coffee, hit a traditional <em>Bäckerei</em> (bakery) — filter coffee for €1.50 with a fresh <em>Brötchen</em>.' },

Beer: <strong>€3–5</strong>. Cocktails: <strong>€8–12</strong>. The fish market on Sunday mornings (starting 5 AM) is the traditional post-party destination.' },

Munich\'s upscale bar scene thrives around Maximilianstraße — cocktails run <strong>€12–18</strong>. <strong>P1</strong> and <strong>Heart</strong> are the see-and-be-seen clubs.

Germans gather at beer gardens, Kneipen (pubs), or wine taverns starting around <strong>5–6 PM</strong>. It\'s social, relaxed, and food-focused. Unlike southern Europe, Germans eat dinner earlier (<strong>6–8 PM</strong>), so the evening drinking begins after dinner. The Kneipe (neighborhood pub) is the social anchor of German life — regulars have their <em>Stammtisch</em> (reserved table).

A shot costs <strong>€3–6</strong> at a restaurant. Quality artisanal Schnaps from the Black Forest or Bavaria runs <strong>€15–35</strong> per bottle.

At home it\'s sipped ice-cold as a digestif, not as a party shot. <strong>€2–4</strong> per shot. Other <em>Kräuterlikör</em> (herbal liqueurs): <strong>Underberg</strong> (bitter, medicinal, sold in tiny bottles), <strong>Ramazzotti</strong> (Italian-influenced), and <strong>Killepitsch</strong> from Düsseldorf. Regional herbal bitters are found across Germany — every region has its own recipe.' },

Each region guards its recipes fiercely. Ask for the local specialty at any traditional Gasthof — you\'ll discover something unique.' },

Saying yes is the right move. A cold shot of Obstler, Kirschwasser, or herbal bitter costs <strong>€3–6</strong>. In Bavaria, it\'s practically mandatory after a meal at a traditional Wirtshaus. The ritual: raise your glass, say <em>Prost!</em>, maintain eye contact, and drink. The Verdauungsschnaps is Germany\'s way of saying "the meal was a success."' },

        <p>German drinking culture is not about getting drunk — it's about connection. A Milchkaffee at a corner Konditorei in the morning, a glass of Riesling with Schnitzel at lunch, a Feierabendbier at sunset, then a Verdauungsschnaps offered freely after dinner. Every drink has its place and its time. I've traveled through wine regions across France, Spain, and California, and nothing matches the everyday warmth of German drinking culture. A €4 glass of Riesling at a random Weinstube in the Mosel would cost $15 back home — and it's usually better. The best part? The Gemütlichkeit. Germans don't just pour you a drink; they welcome you into their world.</p>

        <h2 class="ft-protips-heading">Scott's Pro Tips</h2>
        <div class="scott-tips">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Biergarten Strategy:</strong> Munich's Biergärten in Englischer Garten and Augustiner Keller offer the best beer deals in Germany — a Maß (1L) of Helles runs €10–12 and you can bring your own food (Brotzeit). Arrive by 5pm for the best tables. In Berlin, skip the tourist spots around Alexanderplatz and head to the Kneipen in Kreuzberg instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee Savings:</strong> German coffee prices are reasonable everywhere. A Kaffee runs €2.50–4 at most cafes. The real savings: skip the tourist-trap cafes at Marienplatz or Brandenburg Gate (€5–7) and walk one street back for the same quality at €2.50. Local Konditorei often serve excellent filter coffee with a slice of Kuchen for under €6.</li>
            <li><strong>Wine Shopping:</strong> Buy wine at a <em>Weinhandlung</em> (wine shop) or directly from producers if you're in wine country like the Mosel, Rheingau, or Pfalz. Supermarkets carry excellent wines for €5–15 that would cost $30+ in the US. For bringing bottles home, pack them in your checked luggage wrapped in clothes or use wine bottle protectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Nightlife Safety:</strong> German cities are very safe at night, but watch for pickpockets in crowded nightlife areas — especially in Berlin's Warschauer Strasse, Hamburg's Reeperbahn, and Munich's Schwabing. Use licensed taxis or ride-hailing apps like FreeNow. Never leave drinks unattended.</li>
            <li><strong>Tipping at Bars:</strong> Tipping is not expected in Germany but is appreciated. Some places add a service charge. At a cocktail bar, rounding up or leaving €1–2 is generous. Don't tip like you're in the US — 5–10% is considered very generous in Germany.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Value Evening:</strong> A half-liter of local beer (€3–5) with a plate of Brotzeit — pretzels, Obatzda, cold cuts, pickles (€8–12) — at a neighborhood Gasthaus. Total: €12–18 for a genuine German evening. Add a Verdauungsschnaps (often complimentary) and you've had a complete German drinking experience for the price of a single cocktail in New York.</li>
            <li><strong>Bringing Wine & Spirits Home:</strong> US customs allows 1 liter duty-free per person, but you can bring more and pay a small duty (usually $1–3 per additional bottle). Pack wine in the center of your checked bag wrapped in clothes, or use padded wine travel bags. Mosel Riesling and Obstler (fruit brandy) make excellent gifts — we've brought back dozens of bottles with zero breakage.</li>
